| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Snapshot          | ~30 minutes     | Depends on operator availability |

## 2. Time Zone Policy

We operate in CET/CEST (Europe).
US & Canadian orders are processed **in their local daytime hours whenever possible**, but:

* Orders placed outside operator working hours queue for next availability
* Priority is given to orders placed 9:00–23:00 CET
* Emergency/ASAP delivery can be arranged manually

## 3. Honest Expectations 

> “ST² aims to deliver all services as fast as possible.
> All delivery times are targets based on typical workload.
> Because services are performed by human operators, slight delays may occur.
> You will always receive confirmation when your order begins processing.”
