# S1Box Cloud – User Guide

Welcome to **S1Box Cloud**, your fully managed Honeypot-as-a-Service platform.  
This guide is designed for all users, regardless of technical background, and explains how to use S1Box effectively.

---

## 1. What S1Box Cloud Is

S1Box Cloud deploys **decoy systems** (honeypots) that attract and record malicious activity.  
They act like “bait servers” to help you see attacks before they reach your real systems.

You get:

- Real-time attack visibility  
- Activity logs  
- Threat intelligence (Pro plan)  
- Zero setup — everything runs on S1Box infrastructure  

There is no installation, configuration, or server maintenance required.

---

## 2. How Access Works

S1Box uses a **simple token-based system**:

1. You select a subscription plan  
2. You complete the checkout using Stripe  
3. After payment, you receive a **dashboard access token**  
4. You paste this token into the login screen  
5. Your dashboard opens — no passwords, no accounts, no forms

If your token expires (90 days), you can ask us to generate a new one.

---

## 4. Your Dashboard

Inside the dashboard, you can:

- View all attacks in real time  
- See attacker IP, country, behavior, and risk information  
- Switch between your traps  
- Start/stop traps (depending on your plan)  
- Review the last 30–90 days of data  
- Export logs (if available)

The dashboard is designed to be simple, readable, and fast.

---

## 5. What Data You Will See

Honeypots collect attacker-side data only.  
This includes:

- Attacker IP address  
- Attempted usernames/passwords  
- Connection attempts  
- Commands they try to run  
- Time and frequency of attacks  
- Enrichment information (Pro)

**Your own personal information is not tracked.**

---

## 6. Safety & Privacy

S1Box is designed with **privacy-first principles**:

- No passwords to remember  
- No personal profile or account data  
- Only your email is stored (for subscription and support)  
- Tokens are always securely hashed  
- Payment data stays with Stripe  

Your honeypot logs belong to **you**, not us.

---

## 7. Cancellation & Billing

You can cancel at any time using:

- The Stripe Customer Portal  
- Or by contacting support

After cancellation:

- Your traps are stopped  
- You retain dashboard access until token expiration  
- Logs are stored for the planned retention period (30 or 90 days) and then deleted automatically

There are no hidden fees.

## 9. What S1Box Is NOT

S1Box is not:

- A firewall  
- An antivirus  
- A full intrusion detection system  
- A substitute for cybersecurity best practices  

It is a **detection and early-warning tool**.

---
